Clever Settings is a Dart package that provides an easy way to manage and store settings for your application. It uses Hive, a lightweight and fast key-value store, to persist the settings data.

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Clever Settings you must have the [Dart SDK][dart_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Add `clever_settings` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  clever_settings:
```

Install it:

```sh
dart pub get
```

---

## Initialization

Before you can start using Clever Settings, you need to initialize [Hive](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/README?id=initialize) first by calling `Hive.init` (or `Hive.initFlutter`). Call the open function once at the start of your application:

```dart
// Initialize Hive before this
await CleverSettings.open();
```

## Usage

Clever Settings provides two classes for managing settings: SettingsValue and SerializableSettingsValue. SettingsValue is used for storing primitive types like bool, int, String, etc. SerializableSettingsValue is used for storing complex objects that can be serialized to and from JSON.

### SettingsValue

To create a new `SettingsValue`, simply provide a unique name for the setting and an optional default value:

```dart
final mySetting = SettingsValue<bool>(name: 'mySetting', defaultValue: true);
```

You can then get or set the value of the setting. This automatically stores the setting to storage:

```dart
final currentValue = mySetting.value;
mySetting.value = false;
```

You can also listen to changes to the setting by calling the `watch` function:

```dart
final stream = mySetting.watch();
stream.listen((newValue) {
  // do something with the new value
});
```

### SerializableSettingsValue

`SerializableSettingsValue` works the same way as `SettingsValue`, but you also need to provide `fromJson` and `toJson` functions to serialize and deserialize the value:

```dart
final myObjectSetting = SerializableSettingsValue<MyObject>(
  name: 'myObjectSetting',
  fromJson: (json) => MyObject.fromJson(json),
  toJson: (object) => object.toJson(),
);
```
